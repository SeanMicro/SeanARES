Prepare a list of samples to provide sequencing data for the PMT program.

There are four sample types, broken up by two categories, that are candidates for sequencing

Product:
Micro-5 = Raw stool samples, no processing performed
Micro-6 = Post production FMT swab

Clinical Receiving:
PMTR_rectal: rectal swabs from FMT recipients
PMTR_stool: stool swabs from FMT recipients, does include the CDT+ swabs


Lets Load our libraries and data

##Clean Data##

##Micro_5

PMT_Micro_5 <- PMT_Micro_5 %>% filter(`Sample Identifier` == "PMT-Microbiome-5")

PMT_Micro_5 <- PMT_Micro_5 %>% filter(Location != "NA")

PMT_Micro_5 <- PMT_Micro_5 %>% mutate(Seq = str_detect(Location,"Kelly")) %>% 
  filter(Seq == FALSE)


##Micro_6

PMT_Micro_6 <- PMT_Micro_6 %>% filter(`Sample Identifier` == "PMT-Microbiome-6")

PMT_Micro_6 <- PMT_Micro_6 %>% filter(Location != "NA")

PMT_Micro_6 <- PMT_Micro_6 %>% mutate(Seq = str_detect(Location,"Kelly")) %>% 
  filter(Seq == FALSE)

##PMTR Rectal##

PMTR_rectal <- PMTR_rectal %>% 
  mutate(Seq = str_detect(Location, "Kelly")) %>% 
  filter(Seq == FALSE)

##PMTR Stool##

PMTR_stool <- PMTR_stool %>% 
  mutate(Seq = str_detect(Location, "Kelly")) %>% 
  filter(Seq == FALSE)


##Need to find the CDT+ from PMTR stool swabs##


PMTR_stool_CDT <- PMTR_stool %>% 
  filter(Identifier == "CDT+")


##We want to do all of the PMTR samples since its only 40 samples and they are significant##

PMTR_total<-rbind(PMTR_rectal,PMTR_stool)

##We need to make a choice on which samples we want to sequence out of the products##

##Lets see breakdown products by donors##

PMT_Micro_5 %>% 
  group_by(`Ext Participant ID`) %>% 
  summarise(occurance = str_count(`Ext Participant ID`,"Donor")) %>% 
  count(occurance)

PMT_Micro_6 %>% 
  group_by(`Ext Participant ID`) %>% 
  summarise(occurance = str_count(`Ext Participant ID`,"Donor")) %>% 
  count(occurance)
